                <h1>What is Base?</h1>
                <p>Base is a system built to help Ethereum work faster and cheaper. It handles some of the tasks away from the main Ethereum network, making it less crowded and less expensive to use, while still staying safe and connected to Ethereum.</p>

                <h1>Analogy of Base</h1>
                <p>Think of Ethereum as a busy highway where cars represent individual transactions. Each car can only carry a few passengers, so when too many cars try to travel at once, the road gets congested. Now, imagine buses that can carry many passengers at once. When there are a lot of transactions to process, these buses can take more transactions and send them to Ethereum efficiently. This helps clear the road and keeps traffic flowing smoothly for everyone.</p>

			<h1>Coinbase Wallet</h1>
            <p>Coinbase Wallet is like the <b>Gcash</b> of Web3. This is where we store and hold crypto assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Slime. It also allows you to browse and connect to Web3 applications, send and receive other cryptocurrency tokens, and buy or collect NFTs.</p>              
			<p>We use Ethereum for every transaction we make, similar to processing fees on banking apps.</p>
			<p>Note:Always make sure to use the browser from Coinbase Wallet when interacting with Web3 Application</p>

			<h1>Base Names</h1>
			<p>Every Coinbase Wallet has its own unique ID called a wallet address. This address is made up of random characters and numbers, making it hard to remember. That’s where Base Name comes in. Instead of using the long wallet address, you can use a simpler username (like jesse.base.eth) as your identity on the blockchain. This makes it much easier to send crypto tokens to your friends!</p>

			<h1>Meme</h1>
			<p>Meme coins are made to help regular people, or "normies," get into crypto because they use funny ideas and popular memes that are easy to understand. Unlike complicated crypto projects, meme coins focus on fun and community, making it simpler for everyone to join in and enjoy the experience.</p>

			<h1>SLIME as a MEME</h1>
			<p>I created slimes as a fun project for people to vibe with. Slimes are cute, formless monsters that love to eat just about anything. I also like to make funny memes that are easy for everyone to understand, helping to bring people into the community. Our goal is to build a large community on Base!</p>
